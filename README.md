Script that converts a PNG into tiles and a tilemap for the Game Boy

This was cobbled together in an evening. Currently to use it, your image will need to be:

- Resolution: 160x144
- Colormap set to 4 maximum colors (no transparency)

As of right now, this script doesn't have a good way to map colors to the Game Boy palette. That will come later.
